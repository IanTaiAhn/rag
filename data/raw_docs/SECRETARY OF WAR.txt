SUBJECT: Reduction of Mandatory Training Requirements to Restore Mission Focus 
The Department of War is committed to enabling our warfighters to focus on their core 
mission of fighting and winning our Nation's wars without distraction. Mandatory Department 
training will be directly linked to warfighting or otherwise be consolidated, reduced in 
frequency, or eliminated. 
To ensure these actions are implemented expeditiously, I direct the Military Departments 
to work, in coordination with the Components listed herein, on the following actions: 
• Chief Information Officer of the Department of War: 
- Narrowly tailor Records Management training to Service member roles and allow 
flexibility in training delivery. 
- Relax the mandatory frequency for Cybersecurity training. 
- Automate information management systems to eliminate training requirements. 
• The Under Secretary of War for Intelligence and Security: 
- Relax the mandatory frequency for Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) 
training. 
• The Assistant to the Secretary of War for Privacy, Civil Liberties, and Transparency: 
- Remove Privacy Act Training from the Common Military Training (CMT) list. 
• The Under Secretary of War for Personnel and Readiness: 
- Eliminate mandatory frequency for Combating Trafficking in Persons refresher 
training after appropriate legislation is enacted. 
- Consolidate mandatory training topics, as appropriate.

CMT Consolidation. The Military Departments will provide the Under Secretary of War 
for Personnel and Readiness an integrated CMT program plan, incorporating the following 
guidelines: 
• Coordinate with the Office of the Secretary of War Components that oversee CMT 
topics to ensure all learning objectives meet expected outcomes. 
• CMT focused on harmful behaviors must clearly delineate the differences between 
prevention and response, identifying appropriate response procedures and resources 
to adequately address Service member support, chain of command actions, and 
requirements for investigation and legal action. 
• Integrated training programs may be delivered online, in-person, or in hybrid formats, 
and may incorporate Service-mandated content along with CMT topics. The use of 
test-out options is strongly encouraged for refresher training. 
These critical efforts to eliminate, reduce, and consolidate focus topics advances my 
emphasis on warfighting. The Department will prioritize these actions and execute with urgency 
to strengthen the lethality of our Nation's fighting Force.

SUBJECT: Implementation of Military Equal Opportunity and Equal Employment Opportunity 
Reform Plan 
References: (a) Secretary of Defense Memorandum "Restoring Good Order and Discipline 
Through Balanced Accountability," April 23, 2025 
(b) Acting Chair, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Memorandum 
"Restoring and Protecting the Presumption of Innocence in the EEO Complaint 
Process," May 15, 2025

"Guidance to Agencies for Applying Deferred Resignation Program 
Agreements to Pending EEO Complaints," May 15, 2025 
The Military Equal Opportunity (MEO) and Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) 
programs are important for preventing and responding to incidents of discrimination and 
harassment. On April 23, 2025, I directed a comprehensive review of the Department of War's 
MEO and EEO programs (reference (a)). 
Based on the results of that review, I direct the Under Secretary of War for Personnel and 
Readiness (USW(P&R)) to implement key reforms across the Department's MEO and EEO 
programs to optimize organizational effectiveness, ensure readiness, and prevent abuse of 
process. The USW(P&R) will coordinate with the Secretaries of the Military Departments and 
other Do W Components as necessary to obtain information, ensure alignment, and drive 
consistent execution of these reforms across the Department. The USW(P&R) is authorized and 
delegated the authority to provide additional policy and implementation guidance as needed 
outside the normal Do W issuance process to facilitate implementation efforts and ensure 
synchronization across all applicable stakeholders. This authority may not be further delegated. 
These reforms must ensure that: 
• Complaints are promptly (within 30 days) addressed and dismissed if they lack 
actionable, credible evidence; 
• Favorable personnel actions such as awards, promotions, and retirements, involving 
alleged offenders are only withheld where a preliminary or subsequent investigation 
indicates that the complaint is likely to be substantiated; and 
~I !Ulm i1m !IIIIH 
OSD00986S-25/CM DO 12537-25 
• Those who knowingly submit false complaints and repeatedly submit frivolous 
complaints are held accountable, pursuant to applicable laws and regulations. 
MEO Reforms: 
• To foster a more effective support and resolution-based program, replace the current 
anonymous reporting option with a confidential complaint reporting option to MEO 
professionals and request that the Joint Service Committee on Military Justice 
consider revising Military Rule of Evidence 514 to include communications to MEO 
professionals. 
• To strengthen efficiency and fairness within the MEO complaint resolution process, 
standardize the intake processes to provide mediation as a first-line alternative to 
filing a formal MEO complaint in accordance with Department of Defense Instruction 
(DoDI) 1350.02, "DoD Military Equal Opportunity Program," September 4, 2020, as 
amended. This approach fosters early conflict resolution and reduces administrative 
burden. Unless required by law, MEO complaints that lack sufficient merit to trigger 
an investigation will be systematically dismissed under new threshold criteria, 
ensuring that resources are directed toward complaints containing credible evidence. 
Credible evidence will be defined in updated policy. 
• To promote prompt closure and accountability, mandate a strict resolution timeline 
for commanders to address unsubstantiated MEO complaints, within 7 business days, 
to ensure timely resolutions. 
• I direct the USW(P&R) to amend and update DoDI 1350.02 to include provisions 
clarifying that false complaints may constitute a violation of Article 107 of the 
Uniform Code of Military Justice. These updates will reinforce the integrity of the 
MEO complaint process. 
EEO Reforms: 
• Centralize EEO Program Organization and Operation. Consolidating and centralizing 
EEO counselor operations will ensure consistent application and timely resolution of 
EEO complaints, allowing DoD leaders to focus on national security. Within 30 days 
from the date of this memorandum, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for 
Civilian Personnel Policy (DASW(CPP)) will develop and implement a plan to 
establish a Do W pilot within the Defense Agencies and the Do W Field Activities 
(DAF As) to consolidate and centralize EEO personnel, offices, and operations. This 
pilot will also establish a temporary EEO Task Force that includes OSD manpower, 
human resources, comptroller, information technology (IT), and legal representatives; 
representatives from the DAF As; and other relevant stakeholders as needed. 
Additionally, the pilot will institute a technology solution and define funding 
resources required. The DASW(CPP) will conduct an evaluation at the end of the 
pilot to incorporate the Military Departments. 
2 
• Expedite Senior Official EEO Cases. Preventing delays and avoiding the indefinite 
suspension of careers empowers Do W leaders to get back to doing what they do best, 
warfighting. The Director, Defense Human Resources Activity (DHRA) will define 
and allocate funding for the Investigations and Resolutions Directorate (IRD) to 
leverage outsourcing and alternative IT solutions, like artificial intelligence to 
expedite investigation of cases that directly affect general/flag officers and senior 
executives. 
• Centralize EEO Investigations. Consolidating investigations under the IRD enhances 
accountability, increases oversight, and standardizes policy implementation. Within 
30 days from the date ofthis memorandum, the Director, DHRA, will provide a plan 
of action and milestones to the DASW(CPP) detailing the process for eliminating the 
EEO investigation backlog and manpower and funding resources required to sustain 
long-term operational capability in accordance with 29 CFR Part 1614 and EEOC 
Management Directive 110. 
• Acceptance and Dismissal of EEO Complaints. In accordance with 29 CFR § § 
1614.106(b) and 1614.107(a), where the Agency has made a written request for the 
complainant to provide relevant information or documentation, if the complainant 
fails to respond or adequately address the Agency's request within 15-days ofreceipt, 
the complaint be dismissed. The DASW(CPP) will, no later than 60 days, coordinate 
with EEOC to request an establish exception to modify the timeline for acceptance 
and dismissal of EEO complaints. 
• Adhere to EEOC Reform Initiatives. EEOC's reforms are also Do W's priority to 
advance timeliness, efficiency, and accountability across the Department's EEO 
process. Consistent with references (b), (c), and (d), I hereby direct the USW(P&R) 
to advance an EEO policy memorandum to remove unauthorized monetary sanctions 
and dismissal of outstanding claims for individuals who exercised the Deferred 
Resignation Program with general release clauses. Additionally, I direct the 
USW(P&R) to update current DoW policy to eliminate the practice of withholding or 
delaying promotion of an employee or Service member based on an EEO complaint 
without a substantive finding of misconduct or not based on objective and credible 
evidence. The USW(P&R) will update Do W policy to reflect the definition of 
credible evidence contained in reference (a) consistent with applicable law. 
• Do W Exception to EEOC timelines for Processing Investigations. Timely 
investigations bolster the credibility of the EEO process by ensuring complaints are 
addressed timely. The Department's priority must be to preserve the integrity of the 
EEO process for both the complainant and alleged offender. The DASW(CPP) will, 
no later than 60 days from the date ofthis memorandum, coordinate with EEOC to 
establish an exception to modify Do W's EEO investigation time lines. 
• Establish Compliance Measures to Track EEO Reform Actions. Tracking and 
monitoring the execution and implementation of the EEO process is essential to 
upholding the efficacy ofthe Department's commitment to provide timely resolutions 
3 
of allegations. The DASW(CPP) will develop a compliance assessment framework to 
monitor the implementation of the EEO reform actions and submit an annual progress 
report to the USW(P&R). 
Timely adjudication of complaints will minimize the impact of false claims, swiftly 
provide resolution for all involved, and increase readiness across the total force. I am fully 
committed to promoting good order and discipline through accountability for all involved in the 
•complaint process.

COMMANDERSOFTHECOMBATANTCOMMANDS 
DEPARTMENT OF WAR AGENCY AND DOW FIELD ACTIVITY 
DIRECTORS 
SUBJECT: Military Fitness Standards 
As I stated in my initial message to the Force, "Our standards will be high, 
uncompromising, and clear." To ensure the lethality and readiness of America's fighting Force, 
military leaders at all levels must ensure our Warfighters are prepared to meet the demanding 
requirements of combat by enforcing standards and leading by example. Our military' s 
discipline and excellence are what sets it above others across the globe. 
My goal is unmistakable: our core fighting formations must not just meet the standard -
they must embody it. We need high, uncompromising, sex-neutral standards rooted in combat 
effectiveness. Every warfighter must be held to the same rigorous expectations. 
This directive outlines immediate actions to ensure every warfighter meets the physical 
and professional demands of combat, for which every Service member must be prepared. These 
requirements are not optional - they are foundational to our lethality and readiness. 
Fitness Testing Requirements 
Active Component Service members will execute two fitness tests annually: 
• One will be the existing Service Fitness Test. 
• The second will be: 
- A Combat Field Test for combat arms personnel (see attached list). 
- A Combat Readiness Test for non-combat arms personnel or the Service Fitness 
Test. 
• Service members will perform physical fitness training every duty day. 
National Guard and Reserve Component members will: 
• Take personal responsibility to maintain an appropriate physical fitness regimen, 
regardless of duty status. 
• Complete one fitness test annually, aligned to their combat or non-combat arms 
designation. 
l ! I Ill I I II~Uli H111111 1 
OSD0 107 13-25/CMDO 13668-25 
Each Military Department will verify and validate its Combat Field Test within 60 days 
and submit an execution plan for National Guard and Reserve Component implementation. 
Regardless of Component, failure to meet established standards may be used to withhold 
favorable personnel actions, to include denied promotions, and administrative separation in 
accordance with standing regulations. 
Fitness Testing Matrix 
The following matrix outlines the specific fitness test requirements for combat arms and 
non-combat arms personnel. It is designed to clarify which evaluations apply to each category of 
Service member and ensure consistent enforcement across the Joint Force. 
Test Type Combat Arms Personnel Non-Combat Arms 
Personnel 
Service Fitness Test Sex-neutral; age-normed 
(simplified); male-standard; must 
achieve 70% average, across all 
elements 
Sex-normed, age-normed 
Combat Field Test Required: Service-determined 
standards*; must be executable in 
any environment, at any time, with 
combat equipment 
Not applicable 
Combat Readiness Test Not applicable Required; but may be 
substituted with the Service 
Fitness Test; must be 
executable in any 
environment, at any time, 
with combat equipment as 
appropriate. 
*For example, Army Expert Physical Fitness Assessment or Marine Corps Combat Fitness Test 
Body Composition 
Each Military Department will align with medically validated, streamlined approaches -
using height and waist circumference method - to promote consistency and fairness across the 
Joint Force. The Military Departments will ensure that Service members are evaluated twice per 
year. 
Within 60 days, the Office of the Under Secretary of War for Personnel and Readiness 
will publish additional guidance on the height and waist standards that will take effect during the 
next calendar year. 
High performers on fitness tests may be granted exemptions, but only within defined 
limits. High performance does not excuse non-compliance with body composition standards. 
2 
Members exceeding body composition limits will be placed in remedial programs; those 
not demonstrating adequate progress will be subject to administrative measures to include 
processing for administrative separation. 
Leadership and Enforcement 
To uphold these standards across the Force, leadership must be both entrusted to lead and 
accountable for failure. The following actions are required to ensure consistent enforcement and 
transparency at every level: 
• Standards must be clearly communicated across the Force to set high expectations. 
• Leaders at all levels are expected and empowered to enforce standards consistently. 
Standards left unenforced are not truly standards. 
• Leaders will be held accountable if physical fitness and body composition standards 
are not enforced within their units. 
Each Military Service will establish or enhance electronic training records to ensure: 
• Performance outcomes, including scores - not just pass/fail - are recorded and 
reflected in fitness reports and evaluations. 
• Individual physical training requirements are documented and visible to each Service 
member. 
• Regular evaluations of the electronic training records are conducted to assess 
compliance. 
Our Warfighters must always demonstrate the highest standards of physical fitness and 
combat readiness. Where expectations are not met, we must choose quality over quantity and 
lethality over complacency. 
Fitness should be regarded with the same seriousness as Professional Military Education. 
Fitness is not a check box - it is a core competency, as vital as Professional Military Education. 
Every Military Unit and individual Service member must strive to exceed the standard, not settle 
for it. 
If someone consistently treats the bare minimum as their standard, then they are not a fit 
for our fighting Force. The American people expect nothing less - and we must deliver.

DEPARTMENT OF WAR AGENCY AND DOW FIELD ACTIVITY 
DIRECTORS 
SUBJECT: Department of War Military Education and Training Standards 60-Day Review 
To prepare for large scale combat operations in a rapidly changing global landscape, the 
Department of War requires a renewed focus on accountability, meritocracy, and rigorous 
standards in the military education and training programs that forge leaders with the character, 
skills, and knowledge essential for maintaining our military's dominance. 
To ensure we are developing the warriors we need to dominate in theater- and multitheater warfare, I direct a comprehensive 60-day, ''Education System Curricula and Training 
School Standards Review," including all Military Service Academies, military educational 
institutions (MEis), and military training schools. 
Comprehensive Review. Military education and training must equip our warfighters 
with the physical and cognitive skills and experiential instruction required to execute our strategy 
and meet the high standards required to succeed in combat. To achieve these objectives, I direct 
the following actions within 60 days of this memorandum: 
• The Secretaries of the Military Departments and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff will each conduct a comprehensive review of their respective MEI curricula. 
• The Secretaries of the Military Departments will also comprehensively review their 
training school standards, with a particular emphasis on warrior-focused combat 
training programs such as, and not exclusively, The Basic School, Airborne School, 
Ranger School, and Basic Underwater Demolition School. 
- Report any changes to program standards since 1990 and make recommendations 
on whether to restore any standards that have been lowered since that time. 
• The Secretaries of the Military Departments and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff will each report their findings to the Under Secretary of War for Personnel and 
Readiness. 
The strength and lethality of our military is forged in professional development and 
training programs anchored in mission accomplishment. We must act today to develop the 
warfighters we need tomorrow.

SUBJECT: Review of Hazing, Bullying, and Harassment Definitions 
Department policy defining conduct by Service members that constitutes hazing, 
bullying, and harassment is overly broad, jeopardizing combat readiness, mission 
accomplishment, and trust in the organization. To maintain a lethal and ready Force, leaders 
must be empowered to make the right decisions, enforce standards, and restore good order and 
discipline. However, definitions that are overly broad hinder leaders' ability to effectively 
execute the mission. 
I am directing the Under Secretary of War for Personnel and Readiness to conduct a 
30-day review of the Department's definitions of these behaviors. When commanders face 
undue administrative burdens, it distracts from their core mission. This review aims to strike a 
balance, ensuring leaders have the tools necessary to foster a warrior ethos rooted in mutual 
respect and accountability, while also maintaining a lethal and ready Force.

SUBJECT: Modem Workforce Management 
My priority as Secretary of War is restoring the warrior ethos. This applies to every 
member of the Department, including our highly skilled civilian employees, who are oftentimes 
paid less than their private sector equivalents. These employees provide critical continuity in 
support of our Service members and act as force multipliers in defending this great Nation. 
We recently surveyed our civilian workforce. We heard loud and clear that personnel 
policies must better reflect our high-performance culture. This requires reforming how we treat 
both top and bottom performers. Winning organizations optimize the workforce spectrum. 
First, we need to incentivize and reward our top performers. Department employees are 
not in it for the money, but our best performers need to be appropriately recognized for their 
performance, including through meaningful monetary awards. Second, managers need more 
guidance on how to separate underperforming employees. Complex offboarding creates cultural 
drag that hurts morale across the Department and hinders our mission. 
This cultural refresh will be led by the Under Secretary of War for Personnel and 
Readiness, whom I am directing to immediately issue specific guidance to address two 
complementary but distinct objectives: encourage workforce rewards and demystify the removal 
process. The Department of War attracts the highest performing workforce in the Government 
because we are mission focused. Collectively, we serve the volunteers who have committed to 
fight for their country, and we will ensure the Department's leaders have the most modem 
workforce optimization tools available to support our Service members.

MEMORANDUM FOR SECRETARIES OF MILITARY DEPARTMENTS 
SUBJECT: IG Oversight and Reform: Enhancing Timeliness, Transparency, and Due Process 
in Administrative Investigations 
The Department of War is committed to restoring timeliness, predictability, and 
transparency in administrative investigations while safeguarding due process. Consistent with 
applicable laws, I direct the Secretaries of the Military Departments to work with the Office of 
the Inspector General of the Department of War to implement the following actions: 
Intake and Timelines. The cunent intake phase for administrative investigations is 
inefficient and inconsistent. To fix this, as permitted by law, a credibility assessment must be 
completed within seven duty days following receipt of a complaint. At that point, the complaint 
must either be closed or an investigation initiated. The subject of the complaint will not be 
flagged during the credibility assessment unless credible evidence supports the allegation. To 
meet this timeline, the Military Departments should explore the use of artificial intelligence with 
human oversight to classify and route complaints, enforce deadlines, protect privacy, and 
maintain audit logs. All non-credible complaints must be closed no later than seven duty days 
after receipt. Non-credible complaints include those filed more than a year after the alleged 
event, unless new compelling evidence is presented, and repeat submissions with no new facts, 
which should be labeled "duplicate," linked to the original case, and the complainant notified. 
Opening Criteria and Standards. As permitted by law, apply uniform, legally sound 
thresholds to ensure formal investigations are initiated only when clearly wananted. The seven 
duty day credibility assessment must remain distinct from the investigation to prevent 
unnecessary delays, personnel holds, or premature external notifications. An investigation 
should be initiated only if the complaint meets credible-evidence standard. Complainants who 
submit complaints that do not meet this standard should be provided guidance, assistance, or 
referral to another venue, as appropriate. Treat triage and fact-finding as preliminary steps, not 
triggers for formal action. Command directed investigations must be closed within 30 days from 
initiation, using standardized notifications, templates, and closure documentation. Ensure 
investigators are properly trained and credentialed in interviewing techniques, evidence handling, 
bias mitigation, and report writing to maintain consistent quality across all investigations. 
Transparency and Predictability. Written updates on the status of investigations shall 
be provided every 14 days to the subject of the complaint, his or her commander, and the 
complainant by the investigating agency. Each update will include the current status of the 
investigation, the anticipated completion date, and the forthcoming steps. However, these 
updates will not contain any pre-decisional or deliberative information. Except in limited 
circumstances, the existence of an investigation alone shall not affect an individual' s eligibility 
for promotion, enrollment in Professional Military Education, assignment opportunities, or other 
personnel actions. 
I 
OSD0 10718-25/CM DO 13672-25 
Tracking Complainants and Subjects. Create a single, accurate case picture from 
intake to closure and use comparable data to drive improvement, compliance, and accountability. 
Prepare for transition to the Defense Case Activity Tracking System-enterprise; until then, adopt 
a common data schema and include command initiated investigations in the repository. Maintain 
and report a small, common set of metrics - cycle times, percent closed at intake, aged-case 
inventory, substantiation rates, and notification timeliness - while ensuring privacy and records 
compliance. 
Repeat and Serial Complainants. Establish clear and enforceable procedures to 
identify and manage complainants who submit multiple complaints without credible evidence, 
that are frivolous , or that knowingly include false information. Escalate reviews to higher 
authorities when necessary to maintain oversight and accountability. Track and maintain 
detailed records of repeat complainants, including linked case numbers and closure reasons, to 
identify patterns and improve complaint resolution processes. Ensure all actions safeguard due 
process, protect whistleblower rights, and uphold the fairness and impartiality of the 
investigation process. Article 107 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) prohibits 
making a false statement with the intent to deceive or making a false swearing under oath. 
Individuals who violate Article 107 of the UCMJ will be held appropriately accountable. 
These reforms strengthen readiness, fairness, and trust. We will move fast, track 
outcomes, and sharpen the Department's lethality and readiness.

CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF 
UNDER SECRETARY OF WAR FOR PERSONNEL AND

SUBJECT: Requirement to Formally Present Purple Heart Medals and Valor Decorations 
As part ofmy commitment to restore the warrior ethos within the Department of War, it 
is imperative that we honor and distinctly recognize Service members and veterans for their 
valorous combat actions and those that are injured in combat. 
Effective immediately, all Purple Heart medals and valor decorations will be formally 
presented to the recipient, or their primary next of kin (PNOK) in the case of a posthumous 
award, in a suitable ceremony that honors the recipient. The only exception is when the recipient 
or PNOK requests otherwise. 
This change will be codified in Department of Defense Instruction 1348.33, "DoD 
Military Decorations and Awards Program," December 21 , 2016, as amended, and Department 
of Defense Manual 1348.33, Volume 3, "Manual of Military Decorations and Awards, DoDWide Personal Performance and Valor Decorations," December 21 , 2016, as amended, during 
the next update. 
This renewed focus on honoring our combat heroes strengthens the warrior ethos and 
reaffirms our dedication to the core mission of deterring conflict and decisively defeating threats 
to the United States, when necessary.

MEMORANDUM FOR UNDER SECRETARY OF WAR FOR PERSONNEL AND 
READINESS 
SUBJECT: Adverse Information Policy 
While the Department of War remains firmly committed to upholding the highest 
standards of integrity and exemplary conduct, the current adverse information policy has too 
often resulted in unproven allegations being considered adverse information, cumulative 
penalties for a single event, procedural redundancies, and unnecessary administrative burdens. 
To address these concerns, I am directing a revision of the Department' s adverse 
information policy within 45 days. The primary objective is to strengthen fairness, safeguard 
due process, and streamline promotion-related decision making. 
The revision must accomplish the following: 
• Establish preponderance of the evidence as the minimum evidentiary threshold for 
adverse information. 
• Reinforce the 10-year rule to limit consideration of outdated adverse material, with 
narrow exceptions. 
• Affirm recognition of the Military Departments' internal processes as valid and 
reliable alternatives to non-statutory Special Selection Review Boards. 
• Prohibit repetitive consideration of the same adverse information across multiple 
promotion points, except as required by law. 
By embracing these changes, the Department will not only honor its commitment to 
fairness and integrity but also reinforce the core principles of the warrior ethos - courage, 
selflessness, and unwavering commitment to the mission. These changes will empower leaders 
to make well-founded decisions that reflect the values of trust, growth, and accountability. In 
doing so, they will support the rebuilding of a stronger, more resilient military and strengthen our 
capacity for national deterrence. This forward-looking approach respects the past, learns from it, 
and ensures our personnel policies evolve to meet the highest standards of excellence, readiness, 
and resolve.

DIRECTORS 
SUBJECT: Grooming Standards for Facial Hair Implementation 
This memorandum provides implementing guidance pursuant to the August 20, 2025, 
directive, "Grooming Standards for Facial Hair," which established uniform grooming standards 
across the Force. 
In an era of increasingly complex operational demands - including high-tempo 
deployments, multi-domain warfare, and expanded emergency response roles - strict grooming 
compliance ensures personnel can safely and effectively employ protective equipment. This is 
critical not only for defense against chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) 
threats, but also for firefighting, disaster relief, and other hazardous mission sets where 
respiratory protection may be required, often on short notice. These standards are essential to 
maintaining equipment compatibility, operational readiness, and deployable force posture. 
Accession Standards 
• All applicants, including reentry candidates, must meet grooming standards prior to entry. 
• Applicants unable to comply will be deferred from accession until standards are met. 
In-Service Compliance 
• All personnel must maintain a clean-shaven face. 
o Sideburns will be above the ear opening. 
o Beards, goatees, and other facial hair are prohibited unless specifically authorized. 
o Mustaches are authorized but will be neatly trimmed; not to extend past the 
mouth corners or into a respirator seal zone. 
• Special Operations Forces units may request modified standards via validated missionessential requirements. However, personnel will be clean-shaven when deployed to 
environments with a high threat of CBRN attack.

OSD010719-25/CMD013673-25 
Medical and Religious Accommodations 
• Medical Accommodations 
o The Department will revert to pre-2020 standards; only temporary profiles for 
medical conditions such as pseudofolliculitis barbae will be considered. 
o All requests require individualized review for operational impact. 
o Approved profiles will be limited to 12 months and must include a treatment plan. 
o Permanent conditions will result in evaluation for administrative separation. 
• Religious Accommodations 
o The Department will revert to pre-2010 standards; facial hair waivers are 
generally not authorized. 
o Individualized review required per Department of War Instruction 1300.17, 
"Religious Liberty in the Military Services," of September 1, 2020. 
o Documentation demonstrating the sincerity of the religious or sincerely held 
belief will be a central factor in evaluating accommodation requests and must 
be sufficient to support a good faith determination by the approving authority. 
o Approvals will be limited to non-deployable roles with low risk of chemical 
attack or firefighting requirements. 
Training and Certification 
• All personnel will complete annual training to validate mask fit and reinforce 
grooming compliance. Masks may be a gas mask or firefighting equipment. 
• Units will integrate training into annual training cycles and report completion rates. 
Deployment and Personnel Tracking 
• Noncompliant personnel - due to refusal, exemption denial, or failed tests - will be 
flagged as non-deployable in the appropriate Military Service personnel system. 
• Repeated noncompliance may result in administrative separation. 
2 
Implementation Timeline 
• The Secretaries of the Military Departments will provide an implementation plan to 
the Under Secretary of War for Personnel and Readiness (USW(P&R)) within 60 days. 
The implementation plan will include: 
o An assessment of the ability to implement training and certification 
requirements, to include any barriers or proposed exemptions for certain Active 
Component, Reserve Component, and National Guard units. 
• The USW(P&R) has the authority to establish policy, assign responsibilities, provide 
procedures, and grant exceptions, as necessary, to implement this guidance. 
• The Secretaries of the Military Departments will publish implementing directives no 
later than 30 days following the submission of their implementation plans, 
incorporating any exceptions to policy granted by the USW(P&R). 
Uniform grooming standards are not about appearance - they are about survivability, 
interoperability, and mission execution. Consistent enforcement ensures personnel can operate 
protective equipment, meet deployment requirements, and support combat and emergency 
operations. These guidelines underscore the Department's commitment to readiness and force 
protection.
